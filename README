### A Project That Keeps Your Personal Notes

You must have sometimes felt the need to write something that you would like noone else to read. A diary, for instance.
This program helps with just that.

# Running the program

After downloading/pulling the files, simply go the terminal or command prompt and type `python app.py` (do make sure you are in the same directory as the file).
That's it! The program will run you through what's required and make you set up a password which you will be required to enter every time you try to access your notes.
Then what's next is simpy for you to write away! Use the `a` command.
Type `h` to get a list of available commands.
